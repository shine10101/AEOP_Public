# Introduction

AEOP is a web-based application offering:

1. Decision support for farmers, researchers and policy makers the ability to investigate the economic, electrical and environmental impact of installing new energy efficient and/or renewable technologies on Irish farms using state-of-the-art mathematical modelling.
2. Optimisation functionality whereby the optimal solar PV system, water heating system and management practices for either maximizing return on investment or minimizing electricity related CO2 emissions on a dairy farm can be easily identified.
3. A summary of electricity consumption (Wh/litre), cost (€ cent/litre) and related CO2 emissions (gCO2/litre) data for a cohort of Irish dairy farms in annual and monthly resolutions.
4. A summary of electricity consumption, cost and related CO2 emissions data (relative to herd size, land use or overall consumption, cost or emissions) for a cohort of Ireland&#39;s beef, sheep and dairy farms between 2014 and 2017, as well as the ability to compare and contrast user&#39;s farm costs with Irish averages.

AEOP will assist with minimizing payback on investments for farmers, maximizing the effectiveness of grant aid for technologies on dairy farms and reduce the agricultural sector&#39;s contribution to overall GHG emissions.

A full comprehensive user manual is also embedded within AEOP. AEOP has been developed in collaboration between the Cork Institute of Technology, Bord Bia, Met Éireann, the SEAI and Teagasc. 

# Getting Started

## Accessing AEOP

Step 1: Open any browser and go to the following URL: [https://messo.cit.ie/agri-energy](https://messo.cit.ie/agri-energy)

Step 2: Scroll to and select the _National Agricultural Energy Optimisation Tool_ icon. 

Note: This is the preferred method of accessing AEOP, as the portal URL is subject to change during periods of maintenance. The most recent AEOP version can always be accessed by following Step 1 and Step 2.

Step 3: Read and agree to the terms and conditions prior to using AEOP.

Step 4: Select appropriate subsection to avail of decision support information

Step 5. When using the _Technology Calculator_ or _Energy Optimisation_ components - Wait a few moments while calculations are being carried out. Note: depending on internet connection, figures may take a few moments to appear after loading bar has complete.

Step 6: Assess the monetary, electrical and environmental impact of installing the selected energy technology on the user&#39;s farm.


## System overview

AEOP consists of the following six subsections:

1. About: This section provides a summary of each sub-section with AEOP, including a glossary of dairy energy related terms.

2. Technology Calculator: The _Technology Calculator_ (below) allows for the calculation of potential payback periods, cost and CO2 savings attributed to the installation of energy technologies such as variable speed drives (VSD) for milking machines, solar PV panels, solar thermal, heat recovery and wind turbines.

3. Energy Optimisation: The _Energy Optimisation_ tool was added optimisation functionality to the _Technology Calculator_, allowing the optimal technology setup and management practices for either maximizing return on investment (ROI) or minimizing electricity related CO2 emissions to be established, for a specific dairy farm.

4. Dairy Energy Statistics: This section offers a comprehensive summary of electricity consumption data from an exhaustive audit of Irish dairy farms where remote data recording commenced in 2008.

5. Beef, Sheep and Dairy Statistics: This section provides a summary of historical electricity cost data collected on a selection of Ireland&#39;s dairy, beef and sheep farms.

6. Help: This section offers users information related to the proper utilisation of AEOP, including an [![instructional video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VID/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljhzfHCSrC8), and ![user manual](https://github.com/shine10101/AEOP/blob/59380e1d3f5ca7ef55897beaa0bb4f51f90d1001/www/teste.pdf).

## Technology calculator features

### Feed-in-Tariff

The impact of various Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) rates on overall ROI may also be assessed. A FIT is a monetary payment to owners of energy generation technologies such as solar PV or wind turbines, for exporting excess electricity to the electricity grid.

### Use renewable system for household electricity

This input is required when assessing solar PV and wind turbine energy technologies. This input is required to consider a planned situation when generated electricity would also provide energy to the farmhouse. If true, an annual electricity consumption figure of the farmhouse is required as an input.

### Start water heating after morning milking

This input represents the demand side management functionality of the technology calculator. By default, water heating is set to be carried out during night hours (beginning at 12 midnight), to avail of cheaper electricity of a day/night pricing system. However, users can assess potential ROI improvements of solar PV and wind turbine technologies due to shifting water heating to daytime hours.
